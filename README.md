# Marine-Animal-Image-Classification
This repository contains code and resources for image classification of marine animals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project includes training multiple CNN architectures and fine-tuning a pre-trained model (VGG16) for classifying images of dolphins, jellyfish, sea rays, starfish, and whales.
